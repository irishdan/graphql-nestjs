# NestJS GraphQL API + React Client Example

This project demonstrates a full-stack application built with **NestJS**, **GraphQL**, **React**, and **Redis**.

Since Iâ€™m not deeply experienced with GraphQL, I chose NestJSâ€™s **code-first** approach, which let me lean on a framework I know well (NestJS) while learning and applying GraphQL concepts.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** (for running Redis)
- **Node.js >= 22.0.0**
- **Yarn**

The project is structured as a **Turborepo** monorepo. Redis runs inside Docker, while the API and web client run locally.

To spin everything up:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
website is here http://localhost:5173/ (May need a manual reload on first run)
api is here http://localhost:3000/

## Manual install

If the oneâ€‘shot script fails, bring services up manually.

### API

```bash
cd apps/api
yarn install              # dependencies
yarn docker:up            # start Redis
yarn dev

```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
yarn install
yarn dev            

```

## Use of AI

AI tools were used in the following ways:

- Activity scoring algorithms: AI helped generate the initial heuristics. These still need refinement, as results can be inaccurate (e.g., inland cities getting surf scores of 20/100).
- GraphQL setup: Since Iâ€™m less familiar with GraphQL, I consulted AI on configuring Apollo Client in the React frontend and designing the schema.

## Improvements Needed

This code is not production-ready. With more time, I would focus on the following areas:

âœ… Testing

Unit and end-to-end tests exist but coverage is incomplete.

âœ… Logging & Observability

Proper logging, tracing, and metrics are missing.

âœ… Error Handling

Error handling in the API is minimal and should be hardened.

âœ… Algorithm Refinement

Improve the scoring logic to better reflect real conditions.
Example: some inland locations rank too high for surfing.

âœ… UI/UX

The location form and general frontend UX need significant polish.

âœ… GraphQL Codegen

I would leverage GraphQL Code Generator more fully to provide stronger type safety across the stack.

## Summary
This project is a starting point for experimenting with NestJS + GraphQL + React.
It highlights the architectural foundations, demonstrates integration with Redis, and leaves room for iteration on scoring logic, error handling, and user experience.
